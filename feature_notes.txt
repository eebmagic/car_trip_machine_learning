Data should be from: August 2018 - April 2019

For model development use a full days data not single trips


FEATURE ORIENTED STRATEGY:
	-Average position
	-total distance traveled
	-average distance
	-total duration
	-average duration
	-longest distance
	-4 Max directional positions (from end positions)
	-Frequent position binaries (visited: church, NView, Wallace)
	-24 Binary hour driving indicators?

BETTER DATA STRUCTURE:
	First trip
	Last trip
	Longest trip
	Average trip
	westmost trip
	eastmost trip
	northmost trip
	southmost trip
