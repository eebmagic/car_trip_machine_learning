# car_trip_machine_learning
A machine learning project that I made to use data recorded from each car trip for several months and try to infer what day of the week it is based on the input data.
Uses several features such as key points from my weekly schedule.
This program groups Monday-Thursday together because my schedule at the time of recording this data was the same on those days.
Usually lands in 55%-70% accurate.
